- 👋 Hi, I’m Kara Nottingham
- 👀 I’m interested in turning coffee into code. Dabbling in automation, scripting, Python-ing and where ever mood takes me. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Kubernetes - I call it "proactive lazyness - work hard today so you can have an easy afternoon tomorrow".
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Python and automation projects - I'm trying to improve my Python/Flask skills and venture into the exciting world of APIs.
- 📫 You can shoot me an email on nottinghamkara-at-gmail.com
