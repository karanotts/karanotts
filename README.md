- 👋 Hi, I’m Kara Nottingham (she/her).
- 👀 I’m interested in turning coffee into code. Dabbling in automation, scripting, Python-ing and where ever mood takes me. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Kubernetes.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Python and automation projects - I'm trying to improve my Python/Flask skills and venture into the exciting world of APIs.
